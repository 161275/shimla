Kalka to Shimla toy train is 109-year-old, a small width railway track also known as narrow gauge railways. It had been developed in the year of 1903 by British. It is an example of great engineering  in India because it was a difficult task to make railway track from Kalka to Shimla at that time. It is because the altitude of Kalka is 2100 feet on the other end it is 5100 feet at Shimla. Darjeeling train had been used as a blue print to make Kalka-Shimla Railways at that time.<br>
 
Britishers were planning to make Kalka-Shimla line as early as 1884 and finally put on task after  Ambala and Kalka’s route had completed in 1891. Finally the route had started on 9/11/1903. Its breathtaking views of the naturally decorated valley can be seen from the window of the Toy Train.  The 1st station Kalka is located on the north end side of Chandigarh, It is origin station and the last station is Shimla.  Toy train very slowly touches its maximum speed limit. It is 35 KMPH.  On the way, it moves crossing the dense forest of Chir pines, Apricot and wall nuts.
